2,"4.5 Stars. A curveball by Morgan Housel. With a twist in the middle, this book opened certain viewpoints that changed my financial conceptions.Being from a third world country, My views regarding money were very much different.Still,money is a subject which every person in this world sees as an object of wealth, greed & happiness. Hard work & dedication is one of the main principles to it.What you get is how you think of it.Here are some aspects I searched out to be useful and actionable :> It’s never as good or bad as it seems in finance. Going out of your way to find Humility when things seem right and Forgiveness/Compassion when things go wrong is the way to find peace with money.Respecting the power of money mixed with luck and risk will help you focus on the things that you can control.To be honest -> I am still to find it, I take calculated steps to find peace with my money. I am a bit whimsical when it comes to money. Need to control my urges> Saving money is the gap b/w your ego and your income. Wealth is something created by suppressing the urge to buy now; so as to have more stuff in future.‘No matter how much you earn today, it won’t create wealth unless you discard the thought of how much fun you can have with your money today.’Save, just save. You don’t need to a specific reason.> Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night. It is different for different people. Some won’t sleep until they see higher returns on their money; for others it may be investing conservatively. To each their own.> For every investor, the single most powerful thing is to increase the time horizon. It pushes results closer to what people deserve. We can be wrong half the time, and yet make a fortune. It’s OK to be have lots of things wrong, you’re human. Chillax.> Using money to gain control over your time & the ability to do that gives you independence. What you want, when you want, how you want, with who you want, for as long as you want to, pays the highest dividend in money matters.> Being nicer & less flashy with money helps infinitely. No one else’s as much impressed of your possessions as you are. What you most Want is Respect & Admiration, which can ONLY be achieved by Kindness & Humility, not horsepower and chrome.> Defining the cost of success & paying it is obvious coz nothing worthwhile comes free. Uncertainty, doubt & regret are common costs of money world. We must view costs as fees, not fines. Getting one thing for another is a way of life in finance.> Worship room for error is a conservative hedge that gives us endurance. It happens by the gap b/w what could happen in future versus what you think that should happen in future. Incentives are huge motivators in life. So, try to get more out of life.> Avoid extreme ends of financial decisions at all costs helps us get over a feeling of regret as we evolve. All our goals & desires change over time.In our childhood & youth, we crave to consume.In our adulthood, we crave to consume and provide.In our retirement zone, we try to consume again.Consumption and Creation are parts of life.Minimize the wastage of money.> Conservative risks taking help us, it pays off in time. Being reasonable, not overly rational, helps the most in our financial decisions. They are mostly taken, not in boardrooms or on spreadsheets, but at the dining table, with family.> Define the game you are playing & make sure your actions are not being influenced by others who’re playing a different game. Keeping the ball in your court is crucial.Respect the mess coz smart & reasonable people can disagree on your decisions, as they vary in their thought process."

8,"This was a short but enjoyable read. The main point is that we are complicated creatures who have complicated relationships with money. It's ok and expected to not base every decision off of cold Excel calculations. Instead of pretending we will, here is some of the advice he recommends:Don't try and time the market. Dollar cost average. 85% of large cap fund managers did not beat the S&P 500. Stock picking isn't the worst thing ever but know the odds are not in your favor. Doing some of that is OK but you should primarily stick with low cost index funds.Always keep an eye on greed creeping in. Make sure to avoid the psychological treadmill of keeping up with the Joneses.Investing a lot when you're younger is so important. The vast majority of Warren Buffett's wealth is because of how early he started investing, more so than having a higher rate of return. compounding is a wonderful thing.Wealth usually ends up being more about how much money you save rather than how much you earn from your job or the right investments.Saving is the gap between your income and your ego.Having money saved gives you flexibility in many facets of life and immeasurable peace of mind. It allows you to do what you want, when you want it.It's OK to do something that gives you peace of mind even if it's not the best financial decision. For example, finishing student loan payments with a 4% interest-rate even though you could make more by reducing payments and investing some of that in the market.Expect the unexpected when it comes to the stock market, and don't pull out monev durina downturns. Have a 1/3 buffer. For example, if the Indian stock market usually returns 6.9% after inflation, prepare for 4.6%. You may retire in a bear market or the past may not repeat itself.To the point of not trying to time the market: only 9% of tactical mutual funds, those that try to re-allocate stock versus bond percentage based on economic forecasts, ended up doing better than just leaving it in. Enduring downturns is the cost of compounding, and it's well worth the price. Think of market volatility as a fee. You get what you pay for.Remember that people, especially the media, tend to air on the side of pessimism even if things usually get better overtime.All things considered, I would recommend this book!"

14,"The Psychology of Money is a great book for anyone who wants to understand how their emotions and psychology affect their financial decisions. Housel, a former investment manager, uses stories and anecdotes to illustrate the often irrational ways that people think about money. He also provides practical advice on how to make better financial decisions.One of the things that I liked most about the book is that it is not just about how to make money. It is also about how to use money to achieve your goals and live a happy and fulfilling life. Housel argues that money is a tool, and like any tool, it can be used for good or for evil. It is up to us to decide how we want to use it.I would highly recommend The Psychology of Money to anyone who is interested in learning more about the psychology of money and how to make better financial decisions. It is a well-written and insightful book that will help you to understand your own relationship with money and how to use it to achieve your goals."

16,"I know what you’re thinking, oh great not another personal finance book? At first I also ignored this book ever since it became wildly popular, as I simply had enough of reading the type of cliche personal finance books after reading the last 2 books about money by a certain personal development maestro. But then I stumbled upon Morgan Housel’s interview at the Tim Ferriss Show. And, to be frank, he’s not what I thought he was.He’s not that typical personality that preach about personal finance from the perspective of “expert slash motivational speaker.” He doesn’t make a sales pitch for some one-size-fits-all formula to get rich, like what most of the so-called finance gurus are offering.But instead, he’s a market guy who understands the complex dynamism of trading/investing, who is obsessed with behavioural finance as the reasoning for market movements and/or business growth, who explains that our relationship with money is not science or math but dopamine and cortisol, it’s fear and greed, it’s pride and envy and social comparisons, or in short our relationship with money is actually psychological.Right from the start Housel remarked that doing well with money actually has little to do with how smart we are and a lot to do with how we behave. And behavior is not easy to teach, even to really smart people. He then added, “[a] genius who loses control of their emotions can be a financial disaster. The opposite is also true. Ordinary folks with no financial education can be wealthy if they have a handful of behavioral skills that have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence.”Hence, the unbelievable story of Ronald Read at the beginning of the book, a janitor who gave away $6 million to the local hospital when he passed away, in contrast with Richard Fuscone, a Harvard MBA and former Merrill Lynch executive who lost almost everything at the end of his story. This, in essence, is what the book is about, the good approaches towards money that can be implemented even by the janitor (that we should emulate), and the bad ones even by the likes of the Harvard-educated executive (that we should avoid).And the first thing that we need to understand is that everyone is different. We have different personalities, different childhood backgrounds, different education, different goals, and thus it is only natural that we have different risk tolerances and attitudes towards money, saving and investment. For example, baby boomers that grow up in the Great Depression era will have different attitude towards risk and reward compared with millennials who live under a low inflation low interest rate environment.Another important point in the book is that tails drive everything. There are around 15 billion lives that were born between 19th and 20th century but imagine 7% of them were never born, such as Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Gavrilo Princip, Thomas Edison, Bill Gates, and Martin Luther King. Or imagine the last century without the small percentage of occurrences such as Great Depression, World War 2, The Manhattan Project, Vaccines, antibiotics, September 11th, and the fall of the Soviet Union. The point is, a small percentage of people or events create the most impacts in history.The same concept also occur in investing. As Housel describes, since 1980 the Russell 3000 index has increased more than 73-fold, which is a spectacular return. However, if we look closer, 40% of the companies in the index were effectively failures, while the 7% of components performed extremely well and were more than enough to offset the flops. And there’s more. Within the most performing companies in the market there are even more tail events. In 2018, Amazon alone drove 6% of the S&P 500 returns, while Amazon’s growth itself was almost entirely thanks to Amazon Prime and Amazon Web Services, while others such as Fire Phone and travel agencies have failed.This is also where Housel emphasized the importance of “batting average”, that it is ok to have small losses here and there as long as the wins can more than compensate for the whole performance. This approach is valid for money and any other functions in life.Moreover, in this immensely informative book in just 183 pages, there are many more lessons on the psychology of money that helps to frame and re-frame our mindsets, such as the relationship between luck and risk, the magic of compounding, the difference between fees and fines, how historical trends are not prophecies, how optimistic-pessimistic outlooks can influence our decision makings, and one important mindset that rarely discussed by any other commercial personal finance books: the importance of contentment.Because ultimately, Housel concluded, “wealth is what you don’t see. Wealth is the nice cars not purchased. The diamonds not bought. The watches not worn, the clothes forgone and the first-class upgrade declined. Wealth is financial assets that haven’t yet been converted into the stuff you see.”Indeed, the aim of this book is not to sell the author’s service, but it is to give us the complete psychological understanding of our relationship with money, and how to have a better attitude at it. And for that reason, this book offers a fresh perspective in an already saturated personal finance industry. Which is why this is one of the most influential books that I’ve ever read. No wonder it’s so damn popular."

22,"The enlightening, no-nonsense content of this book truly reaches over and applies to many facets of life, not just finance. I found this book to be very reassuring and encouraging, as I was surprised to realize that my husband and I already follow many of the strategies presented here. (We are very low-income overseas missionaries serving in the third world, but even so the principles found in this book apply to our limited financial range.) I especially appreciated all of the unique anecdotes, historical lessons and quotes pulled from various realms of society to further illustrate the book's key points in each chapter."

24,"The parts that strike a cord with me most are on the topic of compounding, enough and moving goalpost. I’ve been reading a lot regarding trading psychology in recent years and I found that most of the concepts can be equally apply to life. Life is a journey that we need to make a lot of choices. For every choice we make there comes risk and reward. So in a sense it’s a risk management process. Risk management is a probability game. No matter how smart we make our choices, chances are we can still lose if the odd turns against us. The early discussion of this book reminded us about this fact. This is a really great book to read if you want to have a better life and have a right mindset to accumulate wealth. Highly recommended."
